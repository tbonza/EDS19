# Security Analysis Utility (SAU)

This application is responsible for checking the security of 
dependencies used in software development.

GitHub already provides [security alerts for vulnerable dependencies](https://help.github.com/articles/about-security-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies/). 
SAU will have to replicate this feature and extend it to provide
compelling value.
