# Security Analysis Utility (SAU)

This application is responsible for checking the security of 
dependencies used in software development.

GitHub already provides [security alerts for vulnerable dependencies](https://help.github.com/articles/about-security-alerts-for-vulnerable-dependencies/). 
SAU will have to replicate this feature and extend it to provide
compelling value.

## Gameplan

1. Authorization server
1. User Interface server
1. Resource server
1. Admin server
1. Replicate GitHub security alert feature (needs to be done by midterm time)
1. Extend GitHub security alert feature

If I can't replicate the GitHub feature by midterm time then I'll
have to ditch this approach and write a research paper.
