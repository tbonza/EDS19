# Vectorized data types in R

Unlike the majority of programming languages where most variables denote a single value of some data type (a _scalar_ value), in R variables denote vectors of values. This section illustrates some of the uses of vectorized data types to build more complex data.

## Matrices

Vectors are a sequence of values of same type. A natural generalization is a matrix. This is a 2 dimensional arrangement of values, i.e. data elements arranged in a rectangular layout. To create a matrix:

```{r}
m1 <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
             nrow = 3,
             ncol = 2,
             byrow = TRUE)
m1
attributes(m1)
str(m1)
```

Notice the `byrow` argument. Let's see what happens if we set it to `FALSE`:
```{r}
m2 <- matrix(c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6),
             nrow = 2,
             ncol = 3,
             byrow = FALSE)
```

To get a vector with all the elements of a matrix:
```{r}
c(m1)
```
To get dimensions of a matrix, use `dim`:
```{r}
dim(m1)
dim(m2)
```

You can obtain the rows and columns individually:
```{r}
nrow(m1)
ncol(m1)
```

Note that a matrix is a vector with two additional attributes, number of rows and number of columns.
```{r}
m1
length(m1)
class(m1)
attributes(m1)

cm1 <- c(m1)
cm1
length(cm1)
class(cm1)
attributes(cm1)
```

To **transpose** a matrix:
```{r}
t(m1)
```

To access element at *ith* row and *jth* column of matrix *M*, use `M[i, j]`
```{r}
m1[1, 2]
m1[3, 2]
```

What happens when we do `m1[5, 5]` ?

To access the entire `ith` row:
```{r}
m1[1, ]
```

To access the entire `jth` column:
```{r}
m2[, 1]
```

These operations return vectors, and not matrices. To confirm this:
```{r}
r <- m1[1, ]
attributes(r)
```

In case a matrix is needed, specify `drop` to be false (i.e. do not drop the dimensions):
```{r}
r <- m1[1, , drop = FALSE]
attributes(r)
```

We can pass `drop` as an argument because `[` is a function:
```{r}
"["(m1, 2, 2)
```

If you have a vector that you want to treat as a matrix, you can use `as.matrix` function.
```{r}
v <- c(1, 2, 3, 4)
m <- as.matrix(v)
attributes(m)
```
To access multiple rows/cols:
```{r}
m1[c(1, 3), ]
```
To combine multiple matrices:

```{r}
m3 = matrix(c(90, 43, -783, 21, 23, 57), nrow=3, ncol=2) 
m4 = matrix(c(37, 12, 0), nrow=3, ncol=1) 
cbind(m3, m4)
cbind(m4, m3)
```
```{r}
m5 = matrix(c(90, 43, -783, 21, 23, 57),  nrow=1, ncol=2)
rbind(m3, m5)
```

Matrix rows and columns can be named. This allows us to use those names as indices for accessing elements, row and columns of the matrix.
```{r}
m6 = matrix(c(90, 43, -783, 21, 23, 57, 23, 65, 78, 90, 32, 4, 3, 67, 0, 12, 32, 76, 32, 9), 
            nrow=5, 
            ncol=4)
rownames(m6)
colnames(m6)
```

What is this `NULL`? It means, a list of 0 items. Let's try to provide names to rows and columns.
```{r}
rownames(m6) <- c("r1", "r2", "r3", "r4", "r5")
colnames(m6) <- c("c1", "c2", "c3", "c4")
```

We can also remove names by assigning `NULL`.
```{r}
rownames(m6) <- NULL
colnames(m6) <- NULL
```

Let's do some matrix operations.
```{r}
mA <- cbind(matrix(rnorm(20), 4), c(1, 2, 4, 6))
mB <- cbind(matrix(rnorm(20), 4), c(8, 3, 6, 7))
```

To add and subtract two matrices, we use `+` and `-` operators. 
```{r}
mA + mB
mA - mB
```
Element wise multiplication and division is done using `*` and '/'
```{r}
mA * mB
mA / mB
```
These operations can be done with a constant. In that case R recycles the constant.
```{r}
mA + 10
mA * 10
```
To perform the mathematical matrix multiplication, we use the `%*%` operator.
```{r}
mA %*% t(mA)
```
To calculate the row and column means and sums of matrices conveniently, R provides appropriately named functions.
```{r}
rowMeans(mA)
colMeans(mA)
rowSums(mA)
colSums(mA)
```
We can also assign to matrices and submatrices. The following snippets of code explain how.
```{r}
y <- matrix(nrow = 3, ncol = 2)
y
y[1, 1] <- 11
y[2, 1] <- 12
y[3, 1] <- 56
y[1, 2] <- 13
y[2, 2] <- 14
y[3, 2] <- 89
```
```{r}
y[c(1, 3)] <- matrix(1:4, nrow = 2)
```

Here is another interesting example.
```{r}
x <- matrix(nrow=3,ncol=3)
y <- matrix(c(7, 8, 9, 10), nrow = 2)
x[2:3, 2:3] <- y
```

Just like the case of vectors, we can use negative indices to exclude rows or columns:
```{r}
m1
m1[-2, ]
```

## List
Vectors and Matrices always contain same type of data values. A List is like a vector that can contain objects of different types.
```{r}
numbers <- c(0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9)
characters <- c("aa", "bb", "cc", "dd", "ee", "ff") 
logicals <- c(TRUE, FALSE, TRUE, TRUE, TRUE, FALSE, FALSE)
l1 <- list(numbers, characters, logicals, 12, "abcd", TRUE)
```
With lists we can reference an individual element or retrieve a slice (sublist). Notice the difference between using `[[]]` and `[]`.
```{r}
l1[[1]]
l1[[2]]
l1[[3]]
l1[[4]]
l1[4]
l1[5]
l1[6]
l1[c(1, 3, 5)]
```
If we want to modify the list contents, an interesting thing happens.
```{r}
l1[[1]]
l1[[1]][1] <- 299792458
l1
numbers
```
Just like matrices, we can provide names to list elements:
```{r}
l2 <- list(primes = c(2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13),
           composites = c(4, 6, 8, 9, 10, 12),
           complexes = c(3+1i, 4+6i, 8 + 9i))
l2
```
To access the elements, we can use the following:
```{r}
l2$primes
l2["primes"]
l2[["primes"]]
l2[1]
l2[[1]]
l2[c("composites", "complexes")]
```
What if we want to access the list variables directly?
```{r}
# primes, complexes and composites are not defined
attach(l2)
primes #primes is defined now
complexes #complexes is defined now
composites #composites is defined now
detach(l2)
# primes, complexes and composites are again not defined.
```
This *attaches* the list to search path for variables and allows list members to be accessed by name. Make sure to `detach` as soon as possible.

## Data Frames

Data Frames are the most useful data structure in R. A Data Frame is a List in which all elements are vectors are of same length. It is useful to store tables of data, like a spreadsheet.
```{r}
firstNames <- c("John", "Oliver", "Mack", "Ron")
secondNames <- c("Green", "Twist", "Brown", "Weasely")
grades <- c("A", "B", "C", "A")
df <- data.frame(firstNames, secondNames, grades)
df
```
Notice how, in the previous example, the column names are automatically taken to be the vector names. 
In R, there is a data frame called `mtcars` provided by default. We will use this for the rest of the lecture.
```{r}
mtcars
```
This is too much output. If we are just interested in inspecting the first few lines of the data frame, we can do the following.
```{r}
head(mtcars)
```
To get information about the number of rows, row names, number of columns and column names of a data frame, we can do the following.
```{r}
nrow(mtcars)
rownames(mtcars)
ncol(mtcars)
colnames(mtcars)
```
To access elements, we can use the familiar `matrix` like syntax.
```{r}
mtcars[2, 3]
mtcars["Mazda RX4 Wag", "disp"]
```
To access a column vector, we can use `[[]]` operator.
```{r}
mtcars[[3]]
mtcars[["disp"]]
```
Since a data frame is a type of list, we can also use the `$` operator.
```{r}
mtcars$disp
```
Another way to do the same is as follows.
```{r}
mtcars[, "disp"]
```
If we want a column slice of the data frame we can use the `[]` operator.
```{r}
mtcars["disp"]
```
This is different from
```{r}
mtcars[["disp"]]
```
A column slice is a data frame. It preserves the row names as well. To get multiple columns:
```{r}
mtcars[c("mpg", "cyl", "disp")]
```
Numbers can be used, though they are less intuitive:
```{r}
mtcars[c(1, 2, 3)]
```
This allows us to retrieve a specific set of columns. What if we want to retrieve a specific set of rows?
```{r}
mtcars[1, ]
mtcars[c(1, 2, 3), ]
```
This generalizes to slices of the data frame:
```{r}
mtcars[c("Mazda RX4", "Mazda RX4 Wag", "Datsun 710"), c("mpg", "cyl", "disp")]
```
Properties of the data can also beused. Say we want all cars whose `mpg` is greater than `20.0`:

1. Get the logical index vector
2. Index the data frame using this vector
```{r}
indices <- XXXXX
mtcars[ XXXXX ]
```

## Combining data frames

To add another row to a data frame:
```{r}
rbind(mtcars, list(21.5, 4, 120.1, 97, 3.70, 2.465, 20.01, 1, 0, 3, 1))
```
To add another column, we can use `cbind`:
```{r}
cbind(mtcars, mtcars$cyl - mtcars$gear)
```
Here is another way of adding a column which exploits R's recycling of values:
```{r}
mtcars$myCol <- c(0,1)
```
## Applying functions to  data frame

Find the maximum and mean grade of each student:
```{r}
students <- c("A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G")
mathematics <- c(12, 10, 13, 15, 9, 5, 0)
chemistry <- c(11, 8, 7, 4, 3, 1, 15)
df <- data.frame(mathematics, chemistry)
rownames(df) <- students
XXXXX?
```
We can extend the dataframe further with these columns.
```{r}
df$mean <- XXXX
```
What if we want to apply a function column wise? For that we have `lapply`
```{r}
sorted <- ??? 
```
Note that this returns a list. What if we coerce it to a data frame?
```{r}
as.data.frame(sorted)
```
Does this make sense ?

## Merging Data Frames

We have two data frames and we would like to merge them (like performing a join in databases)
```{r}
df$students <- students
names <- c("A", "B", "Z")
physics <- c(14, 16, 12)
another <- data.frame(students = names, physics)
merge(df, another)
```
What if the column names which contain matching entries are different? In that case, we can use `by.x` and `by.y`.
```{r}
df$student_names <- students
merge(df, another, by.x = "student_names", by.y = "students")
```

## String manipulation

We review a few string manipulation functions in R. 
### Find substrings
We have a vector of strings, and we want to find those strings which contain a specific substring. In the example below, `strings` contains some names and we want to find all those students whose name is John.
```{r}
strings <- c("John Wiggles", "Anony Mouse", "Van John von Wigglestein", "John Johnny Jonathan", "Another John", "A Person")
grep("John", strings)
```
Notice case.
```{r}
grep("Pole",c("Equator","North Pole","South Pole"))
grep("pole",c("Equator","North Pole","South Pole"))
```
### Find the number of characters in a string.
```{r}
s <- "A cool string"
nchar(s)
```
For data that is not in character mode, the result is ... odd.
```{r}
nchar(NA)
nchar(134)
```

### Concatenate multiple strings
```{r}
paste("Adfdf", "Bd", "Cere", "Dgg", "Euiui")
```
Notice that `paste` adds spaces. What if we want a different character:
```{r}
paste("Amnyue", "Bcbvnd", "Cyuwef", "Dsfsd", "Euin", sep = ".")
paste("A", "B", "C", sep = "")
```

### Extract a substring from a string within a range
```{r}
substr("I am a string containing a substring, how about that?", 28, 36)
```

###  Split a string into substrings 
```{r}
strsplit("12-12-4567-34-45-78", split="-")
```

## Find the first instance 
```{r}
regexpr("Tra", "Ray Tracing Tracker")
```

What if we want to find all occurrences?
```{r}
gregexpr("iss", "Mississippi")
```

## Assemble a string from values of different types

```{r}
i <- 23
term <- "answer"
assembled <- sprintf("The square of %d is the %s.", i, term)
```

## Specify a range of strings for matching

For example, we want all those strings which contain `a` or `u` in them. The formal way to specify them is through regular expressions.
```{r}
grep(XXXX, c("Equator", "North Pole", "South Pole"))
```
What if we want all those strings which contain an occurrence of `a` followed by any character and then character `e`?
```{r}
grep(XXXXX, c("Equator", "North Pole", "South Pole"))
```
To represent any pair of characters, we use `..`
```{r}
grep(XXXX, c("Equator", "North Pole", "South Pole"))
```
`.` represents a metacharacter, i.e. a character, that stands for other characters. Such expressions are called regular expressions. They specify templates for strings to be matched against them. `Nort`, `Niet` etc are examples of strings which can match `N..t`. To search for a literal `.` we need to escape it using `\\` as follows:
```{r}
grep("\\.", c("ae", "bc", "c.i", "o.p"))
```
`.` is just one of the many options available at our disposal. Check out regular expression articles online for more advanced pattern matching.

# Data Wrangling 

This section looks at uses of the tidyverse for manipulating data.

## readr

`readr` provides a faster and possible a more reliable way how to read in common text files. It returns a `tibble` instead of a data.frame. It does not convert character vectors to factors. It does not use row names (or munge the column names). It is usually faster (up to 10x).
```{r}
df <- read.csv("data/101.csv.gz")
df <- read_csv("data/101.csv.gz", na=c(""))
```

## Tibbles

A tibble, or tbl_df , is a modern reimagining of the data.frame, keeping what time has proven to be effective, and throwing out what is not. 
`[` always returns another tibble.  `[[` and `$` always returns a vector.

## Data cleaning

There are many warning, in fact more than 1 per row:
```{r}
problems(df)
```
Check the file: open the file it in an editor, the problem with the data is...

```{r}
df <- read_csv("data/101-1.csv", na=c(""))
problems(df)
```

Now, it is a bit better, but still has problems....
```{r}
library(stringr)
txt <- readLines("data/101-1.csv")
cs <-  XXX?
```
What values do we have?
```{r}
unique(cs)
```
How many of each?
```{r}
XXXX?
```
Which ones are the small ones:
```{r}
which(cs == 109)
head(which(cs == 110))
```
Open the file and check what is going on....
```{r}
df[XXXX]
```
This does not look right.
```{r}
df[XXXX]
all(!is.numeric(xxxx))
all(is.na(XXXX))
```
This is easy to fix:
```{r eval=F}
# this will not work since it is not a data frame, but a tibble
df$AVG_TICKET_PRICE[XXXX] <- XXX
```

```{r}
df <- mutate(df,XXXX) 
```

Let's play with another data file:
```{r}
df <- read_csv("data/136.csv.gz", na=c(""))
df <- read_csv("data/136-1.csv", na=c(""))
problems(df)
```

MISSING



Before removing bad city names, we have `{r} nrow(df)` rows.
```{r}
df <- filter(df, grepl(",", df$ORIGIN_CITY_NAME))
```
After filtering wrong origin city names, we have `{r} nrow(df)` rows.
```{r}
df <- filter(df, grepl(",", df$DEST_CITY_NAME))
```
After filtering wrong destination city names, we have `{r} nrow(df)` rows.

Let's make a nice function that does the reading of each file.
```{r}
readone <- function(filename, n_rows=Inf) {
  message("Reading: ", filename)
  df <- read_csv(filename, n_max=n_rows, na=c(""))
  # remove rows with bad names
  df %<>% filter(grepl(",", ORIGIN_CITY_NAME), grepl(",", DEST_CITY_NAME))
  # fix ticket price
  df %<>% mutate(
    AVG_TICKET_PRICE=
      ifelse(
        is.na(AVG_TICKET_PRICE) & grepl("^\\d+\\.?\\d*$", DIV5_TAIL_NUM), 
        DIV5_TAIL_NUM, 
        AVG_TICKET_PRICE))
  df %<>% select(
    year=YEAR, 
    month=MONTH, 
    day=DAY_OF_MONTH,
    day_of_week=DAY_OF_WEEK,
    carrier=UNIQUE_CARRIER,
    tail_num=TAIL_NUM,
    flight=FL_NUM,
    origin=ORIGIN,
    origin_city=ORIGIN_CITY_NAME,
    dest=DEST,
    dest_city=DEST_CITY_NAME,
    dep_time=DEP_TIME,
    dep_delay=DEP_DELAY,
    dep_delay_group=DEP_DELAY_GROUP,
    arr_time=ARR_TIME,
    arr_delay=ARR_DELAY,
    arr_delay_group=ARR_DELAY_GROUP,
    cancelled=CANCELLED,
    distance=DISTANCE,
    carrier_delay=CARRIER_DELAY,
    weather_delay=WEATHER_DELAY,
    nas_delay=NAS_DELAY,
    security_delay=SECURITY_DELAY,
    late_aircraft_delay=LATE_AIRCRAFT_DELAY,
    avg_ticket_price=AVG_TICKET_PRICE)
  df %<>% mutate(
    date=ISOdate(year, month, day, hour=0),
    cancelled=ifelse(cancelled==0, FALSE, TRUE),
    dep_delay=ifelse(is.na(dep_delay), 0, as.integer(dep_delay)),
    arr_delay=ifelse(is.na(arr_delay), 0, as.integer(arr_delay)),
    avg_ticket_price=as.numeric(avg_ticket_price))
}
```

Easier way to rename columns:
```{r eval=F}
df %<>% set_colnames(value = casefold(colnames(.), upper = FALSE))
```
Read all files:
```{r}
dfs <- lapply(list.files("data", pattern = "\\.gz$", full.names = TRUE), readone)
df <- bind_rows(dfs)
```

### Memory management
```{r}
pryr::object_size(dfs)
pryr::object_size(df)
pryr::object_size(df, dfs)
rm(dfs)
gc()
```

## Exercise: Longer distance in Februrary?

## dplyr basics

- external library, part of the tidyverse

### Verbs

- `filter` - filter observations by their values
- `arrange` - reorder the rows
- `select` - pick variables by their names
- `mutate` - create new / update existing variables with functions of existing variables
- `summarise` - collapse many values down to a single summary
- `group_by` - make the above operate on a given data set group-by-group

- first argument is a data frame
- other arguments describe what to do
- returns a new data frame
- they can be chained together

### Examples

#### `filter`

- filter

![Logical Operations](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/transform-logical.png)

- is.na()

#### `arrange`

- default is ascending
- `desc()` turn it into descending
- `NA` are *always* sorted at the end


#### `select`

- select columns by name
- select columns by range
- select columns except the following
- auxiliary functions
  - starts_with
  - ends_with
  - contains
  - matches
  - num_range
  - one_of
- rename variables
- difference between `select` and `rename` (it keeps all varibales and renames the given ones)
- `everything()`

#### `mutate`

- add a new variable at the end of a dataset
- all functions must be vecorized


```{r}
library(nycflights13)
```

```{r}
flights_sml <- select(flights, 
  year:day, 
  ends_with("delay"), 
  distance, 
  air_time
)
mutate(flights_sml,
  gain = arr_delay - dep_delay,
  speed = distance / air_time * 60
)
```

#### `summarise`

- collapses data frame / tibble into a single row:

```{r}
summarise(flights, delay = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

- it is useful with `group_by()` where the unit of comuptation changes from a single group to multiple groups

```{r}
flights %>% 
  group_by(year, month, day) %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(dep_delay, na.rm = TRUE))
```

### Pipe

- example code without pipes
- example code with pipes

- focuses on the verbs not the nouns!
- they are good for shorter transformation
- with one primary object being transformed
- linear code

- tee pipe %T>%
  - str() 
- assignment pipe %<>%

## tibble

- tweaked data frames
- View() in Rstudio

## dplyr joins

- working with relational data with more than one data frame
- example based on the `nycflights13` dataset


![Database Schema](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/relational-nycflights.png)

```{r}
airports
planes
airlines
flights
weather
```

### Primary key and Foreign key

- **A primary key** uniquely identifies an observation in its own table, e.g. `planes$tailnum`

- **A foreign key** uniquely identifies an observation in another table, e.g. `flights$tailnum` to `planes$tailnum`

```{r}
planes %>% 
  count(tailnum) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```

```{r}
flights %>% 
  count(tailnum) %>% 
  filter(n > 1)
```

- a table does not need to have a primary key
- each row is an observation - but not uniquelly identifiable
- or it can be a completely synthetic key - ID

### Example

```{r}
flights %>% 
  select(year:day, origin, dest, tailnum) %>% 
  left_join(planes, by="tailnum")
```

![X and Y](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/join-setup.png)

```{r}
x <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_x,
     1, "x1",
     2, "x2",
     3, "x3"
)

y <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_y,
     1, "y1",
     2, "y2",
     4, "y3"
)
```

### Inner Join

![Inner join](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/join-inner.png)

```{r}
x %>% 
  inner_join(y, by = "key")
```


### Outer Join

![Outer Join](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/join-outer.png)

- A **left join** keeps all observations in x
- A **right join** keeps all observations in y
- A **full join** keeps all observations in x and y

### Joins

### Duplicates

#### One table has duplicates

![](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/join-one-to-many.png)

- duplicates are preserved

```{r}
x <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_x,
     1, "x1",
     2, "x2",
     2, "x3",
     1, "x4"
)

y <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_y,
     1, "y1",
     2, "y2"
)

left_join(x, y, by = "key")
```

#### Both tables have duplicates

![](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/diagrams/join-many-to-many.png)

- result is a cartesian products

```{r}
x <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_x,
     1, "x1",
     2, "x2",
     2, "x3",
     3, "x4"
)
y <- tribble(
  ~key, ~val_y,
     1, "y1",
     2, "y2",
     2, "y3",
     3, "y4"
)
left_join(x, y, by = "key")
```

### Identifying the columns

#### Natural join

- using all columns that appear in both tables

```{r}
flights %>% 
  select(year:day, hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier) %>%
  left_join(weather)
```

#### Explicit key

```{r}
flights %>% 
  select(year:day, hour, origin, dest, tailnum, carrier) %>%
  left_join(planes, by = "tailnum")
```


# Working with databases

## Connecting
```{r}
library("RSQLite")
db <- DBI::dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "30repos.sqlite")
commits <- tbl(db, "commits")
files <- tbl(db, "files")
parents <- tbl(db, "parents")
repositories <- tbl(db, "repositories")
commits_repositories <- tbl(db, "commits_repositories")
```
``` R
dbDisconnect(db)
```
## Dplyr fun
```{r}
commits %>%
  left_join(files, by="hash") %>% 
   filter(is.na(file)) %>% 
   select(hash) %>% 
   group_by(hash) %>% count %>% 
   group_by(n) %>% count
```
Getting the query
```{r}
commits %>% 
  left_join(files, by="hash") %>% 
  filter(is.na(file)) %>% 
  select(hash) %>% 
  group_by(hash) %>% 
  count %>% 
  group_by(n) %>% 
  count %>% 
  show_query
```
Not re-executing queries, and moving stuff to memory
```
collect()
```
## Copying sources
```{r}
tmp <- tibble(repository = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), label = c("a", "b", "c", "d", "e"))
left_join(tmp, repositories, by=c("repository"="id"))
```
```{r}
left_join(tmp, repositories %>% collect, by=c("repository"="id"))
```
```{r}
left_join(tmp, repositories, by=c("repository"="id"), copy=T)
```
Some limitations
```{r}
predicate <- function(x) x < 1.4e+09
commits %>% 
  select(author_timestamp) %>% 
  filter(predicate(author_timestamp))
```
```{r}
commits$hash
commits %>% pull(hash)
```
